            <li>Jobs to be Done Framework</li>
            <li>Second-Order Thinking</li>
            <li>Opportunity Cost</li>
            <li>Network Effects</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Applying Mental Models in Practice</h2>
          <p>To effectively use mental models in your product management role:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Problem Definition:</strong> Use first principles to break down complex problems</li>

          </ol>

          <h2>Common Mental Model Pitfalls</h2>
          <p>When working with mental models, be aware of these potential challenges:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Over-relying on a single model</li>
            <li>Applying models out of context</li>
            <li>Ignoring conflicting evidence</li>
            <li>Failing to update models with new information</li>
            <li>Not considering model limitations</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Mental models are invaluable tools for product managers, helping them make better decisions and solve complex problems. By understanding and appropriately applying these frameworks, PMs can improve their strategic thinking and drive better product outcomes.
